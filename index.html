	<h3>Learning Depth from Monocular Videos using Direct Methods</h3>
	<p><strong>Chaoyang Wang</strong>, Jose Miguel Buenaposada, Rui Zhu, Simon Lucey<br />
	<strong>[
	<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00175.pdf">arXiv:1712.00175</a>
	]
</strong><br />
Unsupervised strategies to learning a depth estimator are particularly
appealing as they can utilize much larger and varied monocular video datasets during
learning without the need for ground truth depth or stereo. In previous works,
separate pose and depth CNN predictors had to be determined such that
their joint outputs minimized the photometric error. Inspired by
recent advances in direct mehtods for visual SLAM, we argue that the depth CNN predictor can be learned without a pose CNN predictor.
Further, we demonstrate empirically that incorporation of a differentiable implementation of DVO,
along with a novel depth normalization strategy - substantially
 improves performance over state of the art that use monocular videos for training. </p>

	<h3>Semantic Photometric Bundle Adjustment on Natural Sequences</h3>
	<p>Rui Zhu, <strong>Chaoyang Wang</strong>, Ziyan Wang, Chen-Hsuan Lin, Simon Lucey<br />
	<strong>[
	<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00110.pdf">arXiv:1712.00110 </a>
	]</strong><br />
A fundamental drawback to (photometric) bundle adjustment
is: (i) their reliance on having to view all points on
the object, and (ii) for the object surface to be well textured.
To circumvent these limitations we propose semantic
PBA which incorporates a 3D object prior, obtained
through deep learning, within the photometric bundle adjustment
problem. We demonstrate state of the art performance
in comparison to leading methods for object reconstruction
across numerous natural sequences.

Through the experiment, we not only show that asynchronous multi-task training
